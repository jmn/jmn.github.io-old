<p>
It is possible to connect M-x hippie-expand with M-x
ispell-complete-word. A simple way of doing it could be to add the
later function to the <code>hippie-expand-try-functions-list</code>
</p>

<p>
Either by using the M-x customize-variable <code>hippie-expand-try-functions-list</code>
</p>

<p>
or by adding the following line to your .emacs configuration:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-to-list 'hippie-expand-try-functions-list 'ispell-complete-word t)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now calling hippie-expand will, as a last resort, use ispell
completion to complete words.
</p>

<p>
Glorious.
