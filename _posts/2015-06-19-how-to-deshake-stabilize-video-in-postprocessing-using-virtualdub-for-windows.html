<a href="http://www.guthspot.se/video/deshaker.htm">The Deshaker plugin by Gunnar Thalin</a> for Virtualdub on Windows runs over two passes and aims to stabilize shaky video. Here's a small writeup on how to use it.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Get virtualdub from virtualdub.org (64 bit worked fine for me)</li>
<li>Get ffdshow from ffdshow-tryouts</li>
<li>Get the deshaker plugin from <a href="http://www.guthspot.se/video/deshaker.htm">http://www.guthspot.se/video/deshaker.htm</a></li>

<li>Extract virtualdub somewhere where you can easily find it,</li>
<li>Extract the deshaker.vdf plugin in virtualdubs plugins subdirectory</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Open virtualdub</li>
<li>Go to the menu Audio/Interleaving (Ctrl-I)</li>
<li>Enable audio/video interleaving and in Audio Block placement, set "Interleave audio every" to 1000 ms. Click OK.</li>

<li>Go to the menu Video/Filters (Ctrl+F) click the button "Add" on the right hand side.</li>
<li>Select "Deshaker" and click OK (My version was v3.1).</li>
<li>In the "Filter: Deshaker" Options, Make sure "Pass 1" is selected in "Select Processing pass",
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note: There are interesting options here that controls quality.</li>
<li>Click "OK" - and Click "OK in the "Filters" Dialog to close it.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Now there are two play buttons in the bottom left controls of Virtualdub, Click the second one that has a zero below it - This will start the first pass of filter rendering.</li>
<li>After this pass has finished running, Rewind the Video to the beginning using the bottom control button (|&lt;).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now it's time to configure and run the second pass of the deshaker plugin run.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go to the menu Video/Filters (Ctrl+F)</li>
<li>Uncheck the deshaker Pass 1 filter in the checkbox.</li>
<li>On the right hand side, Click Add and select "Deshaker" and click OK, This time in "Select processing pass", Make sure to click the right button which reads "Pass 2", and click "OK"</li>

<li>Make sure that only the Pass 2 filter is ticked in the "Filters" dialog.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note that there are interesting options here to configure borders and such</li>
<li>Press "OK.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Run the pass two rendering using the Play-Zero in the bottom controls.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can now use the menu "File/Save as AVI" (shortcut key F7) to save the deshaked file.
