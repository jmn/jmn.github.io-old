<p>
There does not seem to be a built-in way of editing files which are owned by other users in Emacs. 
</p>

<p>
The two ways that most people seem to be doing it are: via "tramp" or using "sudoedit".
</p>

<p>
Here is one example:
</p>
<pre class="example">
alias E="SUDO_EDITOR=\"emacsclient -c -a emacs\" sudoedit"
</pre>

<p>
With tramp (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/95631/open-a-file-with-su-sudo-inside-emacs">discussion here</a>):
</p>
<pre class="example">
(require 'tramp)
</pre>

<p>
It is possible to edit files like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
C-c C-f /sudo::/path/to/file
</pre>

<p>
There is also an Emacs package called "<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SudoSave">sudo-save</a>" available. 
</p>

<p>
I find it surprising that something like sudo-save hasn't been made available in distributions of Emacs. It might of course have to do with security reasons. I have yet to find an elegant solution. Ideally I would prefer if, when opening files owned to another user, Emacs would ask me if I would want to edit using sudo or in read-only mode.</p>
