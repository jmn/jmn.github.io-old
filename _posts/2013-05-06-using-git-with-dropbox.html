<p>
Having had a bunch of conflicts to some git-files (indexes et c) in
my git repositories in a Dropbox folder I looked for information on
doing it in a more safe/sane way. Found this on stackoverflow:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I think that Git on Dropbox is great. I use it all of the time. I
have multiple computers (two at home and one at work) that I use
Dropbox as a central bare repository. Since I don't want to host it
on a public service, and I don't have access to a server that I can
always ssh to, Dropbox takes care of this by syncing (very quickly)
in the background.
</p>

<p>
Setup is something like this:
</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-shell">~/project $ git init
~/project $ git add .
~/project $ git commit -m "first commit"
~/project $ cd ~/Dropbox/git

~/Dropbox/git $ git init --bare project.git
~/Dropbox/git $ cd ~/project

~/project $ git remote add origin ~/Dropbox/git/project.git
~/project $ git push -u origin master
</pre>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>
From there, you can just clone ~/Dropbox/git/project.git that you
have associated with your Dropbox account (or have shared this
directory with people), you can do all the normal Git operations and
they will be synchronised to all your other machines automatically.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a blog post, On Version Control, [&#x2026;] on my reasoning
and how I set up my environment, it's based on my Ruby on Rails
development experience, but it can be applied to anything, really.

<p>
Then again, as mentioned in the other answers on stack overflow,
there is risk of causing corruption using Dropbox so it might not be
a great idea (in fact, it might potentially lead to horrific
experiences and lost data), so bear that in mind.
