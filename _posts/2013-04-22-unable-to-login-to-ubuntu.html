As I started my machine today I found myself unable to login to Ubuntu using the normal graphical login screen (lightdm). I tried looking through the logs in /var/log/lightdm for clues but did not seem to find anything. 
</p>
<p>
Looking in ~/.xsession-errors however, I found 
</p><pre class="example">
/usr/sbin/lightdm-session: 28: /home/jmn/.profile: Syntax error: end of file unexpected (expecting "fi")
</pre>


<p>
Turns out I had accidentally broken the syntax of the .profile and this caused login to break silently.
</p>
<p>
Simply fixing the .profile (or moving it temporarily) will solve the issue.
</p>
<p>
In case you didn't know, you can open a console in ubuntu by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 and then logging in. To move the .profile you can do
</p><pre class="example">
mv ~/.profile ~/.profile-old
</pre>
