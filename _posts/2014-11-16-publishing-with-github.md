I am trying to find a nice balance between trying to keep most of my notes in Emacs org-mode while still having the option
to compose posts from a web interface. Github Pages with Jekyll does satisfy these criteria, and I don't have to worry about 
hosting options. This does mean that I have to export between org-mode and Markdown formats however.
