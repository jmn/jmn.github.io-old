I use a Chrome/Chromium extension which makes viewing videos on Youtube a
better experience. It is called "Magic actions for youtube". It is a
nice extension, except it tends to be a bit noisy. I.e. when it updates it opens
a page, which is annoying. The extension also adds some spammy looking
"share" buttons when using the "cinema mode" which it enables (it
centers the video and hides other page elements.) Anyway, to get rid
of this annoying little graphic, install "userstyles" from
userstyles.org and create a new style (by left clicking the userstyles
button, select "find more styles for this site" and so on.)
</p>

<p>
Add this CSS:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-CSS"># ma-cin-share {
  visibility: hidden !important;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
select "applies to" "URLs on the domain" and enter "youtube.com", hit
save. And enable the userstyle by checking the box on the left (under
the name you gave it.)
</p>

<p>
You won't have to see the annoying element ever again. Obviously this
trick can be used for any annoying HTML element which has got an
identifying class name or id.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://userstyles.org">Userstyles.org</a>
</li>
</ul>
