<p>
Currently my workflow to create a new blog post is this.
In emacs, I type C-c c which brings up org-capture where I've set up various templates for different types of notes and tasks to capture.
</p>

<p>
I select j "for journal"
</p>

<p>
It opens a window and asks me for a headline, followed by tags.
If I am sure that I want it to be a blog post I add the tag "blog".
</p>

<p>
In the template I've set up empty properties for "excerpt" and "tags" which I can fill out if I want the blog post to have an excerpt or tags.
</p>

<p>
I then write my note (I can at any time hit C-c C-e b to preview it in a browser).
</p>

<p>
C-c C-c to save the note (the capture buffer).
</p>

<p>
If I want to revisit the note I hit C-c o which is the key that I have bound to org-capture-goto-last-stored.
</p>

<p>
This file contains many headings and if I want to preview the exported HTML of the current heading I use the command C-c C-e 1 b.
</p>

<p>
When I am happy with the entry I use M-x org-jekyll-export-current-entry to create the html file in my git repository. 
</p>

<p>
I can then either preview the post locally using "jekyll â€“server" and visiting <a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a>, or add the file to the git repository and commit it.
</p>

<p>
I usually go to the git repository and do a git status:
</p>
<pre class="example">
cd ~/git/jmn.github.io && git status
</pre>
<p>
it shows the new file in the directory "\<sub>posts</sub>"
I then use 
</p>
<pre class="example">
git add .
</pre>
<p>
to add all new files. 
Do the commit:
</p>
<pre class="example">
git commit -am "New post on subject subject"
</pre>
<p>
and push it to the server
</p>
<pre class="example">
git push origin master
</pre>
<p>
(Which I've aliased to "pub")</p>
