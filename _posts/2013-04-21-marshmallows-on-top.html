(via <a href="http://ma.tt">ma.tt</a>) Watched a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_build_a_tower.html">TED talk</a> by Tom Wujec, who is an Autodesk fellow, about the "Marshmallow challenge" (<a href="http://marshmallowchallenge.com">http://marshmallowchallenge.com</a>). Wujec talks about what you can learn from watching teams with different backgrounds collaborate on a design/engineering challenge. Prototype/refine (iterate) is generally a successful method. Introducing high stakes lowered results for non-informed (unprepared) teams but led to improved results for "informed" (prepared) teams who understood the benefit of iterative prototyping.
