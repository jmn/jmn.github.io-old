<p>
I use org-mode to handle notes and I would like to easily publish certain notes from my .org files. Ideally I would like to have two ways of publishing these notes. One from the org capture-buffer. Before I file the capture. I'd do M-x org-publish-to-jekyll. But I would also like to handle edits. I am not yet sure of what would be a good way to do this. There doesn't seem to be a function "org-export-tree-as-html". I am thinking that I could use org-tree-to-indirect-buffer (C-c C-x b) and then export from there.

I asked on IRC and got this message:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-irc">15:05 < BerntH> jmnoz: export only the subtree
15:06 < jmnoz> BerntH: okay, thanks. but how do I do that?
15:07 < jmnoz> via an indirect buffer?

15:14 < YoungFrog> jmnoz: you can add restrictions when exporting. read the help buffer shown from C-c C-e carefully
15:14 < YoungFrog> (something like C-s to restrict to subtree)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In the end I found that using "M-x org-tree-to-indirect-buffer" (C-c C-x b) - doing the edits - and then doing the export (M-x org-export-as-html) does what I want.

Juan Reyero's set-up is the one I prefer:

Gorg Negre's article on Blogging with Emacs org-mode and Jekyll

Error, when trying to set up Juan Reyero's org-jekyll code:
"symbol's function definition is void: org-publish-get-project-from-filename"</p>
