<p>
There are a couple of issues I have with org-jekyll:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I can not publish blog entries from the org-capture.
</li>
<li>the "tags" property does not get translated to YAML.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
What org-jekyll does right:
It uses the subtree heading to create the YAML title and the filename.
</p>

<p>
For maximum lazy easy publishing I could use a post capture hook to automatically:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Run org-jekyll-export
</li>
<li>Add the file to git, commit and push.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
See org-capture-finalize-hook.
