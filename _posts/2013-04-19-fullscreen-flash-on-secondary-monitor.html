<p>Tried watching some flash video in fullscreen on a secondary monitor on X.org but found that flash kept leaving fullscreen mode as soon as I tried to do something on the primary monitor. I found out how to solve it from this page: <a href="http://www.ubunturoot.com/2011/07/fullscreen-flash-video-with-dual.html">Ubunturoot - Fullscreen Flash Video With Dual Monitors Workarounds</a>.

There are several possible solutions mentioned, one involves editing the flashplayer binary file with a hex editor. I used <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lljjmflmcnaigbhnheldbdbplkbhngnl">Maximize Flash</a> for Chrome to solve it for now.
