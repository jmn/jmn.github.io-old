Like many other nerds, I do most of my writing in Emacs org-mode. I am currently adapting <a href="http://juanreyero.com/open/org-jekyll/">Juan Reyero's code</a> to easily publish some of my notes onto this very blog directly from Emacs. I am having some small issues but I seem to have gotten it to work to some degree now!
</p>
<p>
To publish a post I simply make sure that it has the label (tag) "blog", then run M-x org-jekyll-export-current-entry. The org property ON must also contain a timestamp at the moment, but I might change that because most of my log entries contain a timestamp in the title anyway.
</p>
<p>
I also need to fix it so that tags get properly translate from org to jekyll.
